# gRPC 
# Enable fast comunication between microservices and accros data centers
# 'Protobuf' is a Protocol Buffers, used to encode structure data
https://grpc.io/docs/languages/go/quickstart/

Installation:

$ protoc --version  # Ensure compiler version is 3+

# For Go support, install the following libs:
> go install google.golang.org/protobuf/cmd/protoc-gen-go@v1.28
> go install google.golang.org/grpc/cmd/protoc-gen-go-grpc@v1.2

# gRPC-gateway
https://github.com/grpc-ecosystem/grpc-gateway
 

The Example will include :
protobuf definision for two API'S
- create new user
- login user to get access and refresh tokens

VSC Plugin:
- 'vscode-proto3' // syntax highlighting

# gRPC Interceptor
# the interceptor is getting called for every request
# before it is sent to the gRPC handler to be processed

we will implement grpc.UnaryInterceptor()
# to write stractured logs we will use : 'zerowlog'
https://github.com/rs/zerolog
# It helps to write logs output format
